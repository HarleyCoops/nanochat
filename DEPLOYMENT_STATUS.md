# NanoChat Inference Deployment Status

## ✅ Setup Complete - Ready to Deploy!

All deployment files and scripts have been created and configured. The automated deployment encountered authentication issues in the current environment, but **everything is ready for you to deploy manually**.

## 🎯 Quick Deploy (2 Minutes)

### From Your Local Machine

```bash
# 1. Clone/download the repository (if not already local)
cd /path/to/nanochat561

# 2. Run the guided deployment script
./manual_deploy_guide.sh
```

This interactive script will:
- ✅ Check prerequisites
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Guide you through HuggingFace authentication
- ✅ Deploy your Space automatically

## 🔑 Authentication Fix Needed

The deployment requires a HuggingFace token with **WRITE** permissions.

### Create a Proper Token:

1. **Go to**: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. **Click**: "Create new token"
3. **Settings**:
   - Name: `nanochat-deployment`
   - Type: **Write** (not "Read" or "Fine-grained")
   - Scope: Default
4. **Copy** the token (starts with `hf_`)
5. **Use** with deployment script

### Why Previous Tokens Failed:

Both tokens provided returned `403 Forbidden` errors, which typically means:
- Token has **Read-only** permissions (needs Write)
- Token scope doesn't include Spaces access
- Token might be expired or revoked

## 📁 What's Ready

All these files have been created and configured:

```

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

Run the interactive guide on your local machine:

```bash
./manual_deploy_guide.sh
```

### Option 2: Command Line

If you're comfortable with CLI:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install huggingface_hub

# Login (creates token with write permissions)
huggingface-cli login

# Deploy
python scripts/deploy_hf_space.py --space-name nanochat-demo
```

### Option 3: Manual Upload

Via HuggingFace Web UI:

1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/new-space
2. Create Space (name: your-choice, SDK: Gradio)
3. Upload all files from `deploy/hf_space/`
4. Wait for build (~10 minutes)
5. Visit your Space!

## 🎉 What You'll Get

Once deployed:

- **Public URL**: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/SPACE-NAME`
- **Chat Interface**: Beautiful Gradio UI
- **Model**: HarleyCooper/nanochat561 (already on HF)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time streaming responses
  - Adjustable generation parameters
  - Mobile-friendly
  - Free hosting (or upgrade to GPU)

## 💰 Costs

- **Free Tier (CPU)**: $0/month - Perfect for testing
- **Upgrade (T4 GPU)**: ~$0.60/hour - Faster inference
  - Can pause when not in use
  - ~$50-100/month with typical usage

## 📊 Expected Performance

| Hardware | Response Time | Cost |
|----------|--------------|------|
| CPU Basic | 5-10 seconds | Free |
| CPU Upgrade | 2-5 seconds | $0.03/hr |
| T4 Small GPU | <1 second | $0.60/hr |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "403 Forbidden" Error

**Solution**: Create a new token with **Write** permissions
- Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- Type must be "Write" (not Read)

### "Module not found" Error

**Solution**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

### "Space build failed"

**Solution**: Check logs at your Space URL + `/logs`
- Common: Out of memory → Upgrade hardware
- Common: Import error → Check all files uploaded

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is ready:

- **INFERENCE_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide
- **deploy/hf_space/DEPLOYMENT.md** - Detailed Space setup

   ```

2. **Wait** 5-10 minutes for Space to build

3. **Test** your chat interface

4. **Share** your Space URL!
